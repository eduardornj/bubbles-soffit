## 3️⃣ Coverage & Matching Metrics

- **100% of product requirements tested**
- **0% of tests passed**
- **Key gaps / risks:**

> All 13 test cases failed due to critical infrastructure issues:
> - Missing CSS assets (404 errors for /assets/main.css)
> - Missing image resources (404 errors for logo and hero images)
> - Backend server errors (500 errors in BaseLayout.astro scripts)
> - Preload resource warnings indicating improper asset configuration
> 
> **Critical Risk:** Complete frontend failure prevents any functional testing validation.
